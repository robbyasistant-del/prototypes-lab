# Arrow Escape Daily (Prototype)

## Run
Open `index.html` in any modern browser.

## What to test
1. Grid appears with start/end and rotatable arrows.
2. Timer counts down from 60.
3. Solving path from S to E shows result screen.
4. Share card shows score/moves/streak and can be copied.
5. Streak persists in localStorage between runs.

## Notes
- Designed as a rapid concept prototype for validation.
- No backend; all data is local.
